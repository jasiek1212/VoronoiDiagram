# Voronoi Diagram Algorithms Project

## Description
This project was aimed at implementation, visualisation and comparison of Bowyer-Watson and Fortune's algorithms for constructing Voronoi diagrams. It provides step-by-step visualisations and extensive documentation that enhance understaing of the complex ideas that stand behind the code.

## Features
- **Visualizations**: Explore the step-by-step construction of Voronoi diagrams using both algorithms.
- **Point Input**: Users can provide their own set of points to instantly generate and visualize nicely rendered Voronoi diagrams using both the Bowyer-Watson and Fortune's algorithms.

## Usage Instructions for Individual Files

### `main.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook contains visualizations of the individual algorithms in action. Cells marked with `#Editable` contain parameters that can be adjusted by the user (e.g., the number of points). Visualizations related to the Bowyer-Watson algorithm are presented first, followed by the visualization of the Voronoi diagram generated by Fortune's algorithm. The notebook also includes a comparison of the time efficiency of both algorithms for various numbers of points.

### `fortune` and `delaunay` Packages
These directories contain the implementations of Fortune's and Bowyer-Watson's algorithms, respectively.

### `documents` Directory
This folder contains documentation and presentations related to the project.
